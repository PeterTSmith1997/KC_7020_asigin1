A face to face interview was conducted with the client to ascertain their information needs. A large part of the interview was the client talking about their experiences with game balance and game designs, which were the key themes of the discussion. Due to the fact that i was only given a broad subject, my knowledge of the information needs was relatively low, therefore we used an unstructured interview format, as these are useful in a scenario where there is little information about a topic (\cite{easwaramoorthy2006interviewing}). Using this format, the client's information needs were established in more detail, such that they required further information surrounding specifics in game balancing. For example, the use of software and agents in a range of contexts that show automatic balancing.
