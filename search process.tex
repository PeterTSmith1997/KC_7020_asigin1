Kuhlthau's model was utilised as the primary framework to conduct this information search. Kuhlthau developed this six step model, which outlines the human process of information searching, as well as the feelings, thoughts, actions and strategies that follow them. Stages one and two, named Task Initiation and Topic Selection respectively, were performed by the client ahead of the interview.

Stage one, Task Initiation, highlights the uncertainty and apprehension an individual might feel about their lack of knowledge in a particular field. In this case, the client lacked sufficient knowledge about game balance to conduct a wider piece of research.  (Cite K here) Belkin, also identifies this stage as (flow) " current state of knowledge is inadequate." and highlights that the client may find it hard to identify what is of value (\cite{belkin2000helping}).
